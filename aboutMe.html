                <imgcaption class="imgtext2">Hello, I'm Chase Waldronâ€”an aspiring web developer currently balancing a full-time position as a cook at East Bank Club with my studies at the Northwestern University Coding Bootcamp, where I'm expanding my programming skills and knowledge. At East Bank Club, I manage a high volume of orders daily, particularly during brunch service. Creativity has always been a driving force in my life, and learning to code has opened up exciting new avenues for me. Beyond work, I'm passionate about collecting physical media and CRT TVs. Looking ahead, my aim is to contribute to preservation efforts in web development, gaming, software, and other facets of digital heritage.</imgcaption>
